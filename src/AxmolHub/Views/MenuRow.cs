/// <summary>One row of a menu: a glyph, a name, and a tick when this is the answer in force. A row inside a
/// submenu carries no glyph — the parent names the question, the rows under it are its answers — and its title
/// keeps the whole glyph slot as inset, so a child never starts left of its parent. The width is fixed across
/// rows so the ticks land in a column rather than wherever each name happens to end.
///
/// Shared by every MenuFlyout that offers a choice: the assistant's switchboard (<c>MainWindow.BuildBottomMenu</c>)
/// and the diff viewer's view menu draw the same row, so a tick means the same thing in both.</summary>
