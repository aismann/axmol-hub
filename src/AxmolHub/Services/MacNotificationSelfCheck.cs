/// <summary>
/// <c>AxmolHub --check-macos-notifications</c> — the macOS notification channel asserted on the host that needs it.
///
/// <para><b>Why it exists.</b> The macOS path reaches UserNotifications through the Objective-C runtime by hand:
/// a global block, two dynamically added delegate methods, and three ABI constants that the compiler never sees.
/// A wrong offset or encoding builds cleanly and simply never paints a notification — the same symptom as "the
/// feature was never wired up". <c>--verify-shell</c> needs a display, and nothing in the build runs the macOS
/// half of the CI matrix through a real desktop session, so this check fills that cell: it runs before Avalonia,
/// needs no window, and stops short of requesting authorization.</para>
///
/// <para><b>It never asks for permission.</b> Requesting would put a system prompt in front of a CI runner and
/// could not be answered; the probe exercises the production delegate and block instead, and a person still
/// clicks one real banner. The bundle identity is printed rather than asserted: CI runs the bare
/// <c>AxmolHub.dll</c> (no .app), where delivery is impossible by design, and an installed/dev bundle prints its
/// identifier so the test can be told apart from a misconfiguration.</para>
///
/// <para>Output is <c>PASS:</c>/<c>FAIL:</c>/<c>SKIP:</c> lines in English — this is terminal text, not interface
/// text. Exit code is the number of failed assertions.</para>
