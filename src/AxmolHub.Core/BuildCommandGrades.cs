/// is the assistant's ordinary work — it reads a compiler error, changes code, builds again, and every one of those
/// rounds asking for permission is how a debug loop dies. Removing the derived state is not: a
/// <c>rm -rf build</c>, <c>git clean -fdx</c> or <c>dotnet clean</c> throws away outputs nobody can regenerate from
/// what is on disk, and it does that whether or not anything was wrong beforehand. Only the third answer costs a
/// card in every mode (<see cref="ToolRisk.CacheBreak"/>).</para>
///
/// <para>The second answer still earns its keep. It is what lets a stalled command be described honestly
/// (<c>this was a build</c> rather than <c>this was a command</c>), and what points the change gate's advice at the
/// right hazard: two writers in one output directory leave a tree half new, and a cancel does not reach the detached
/// MSBuild nodes or <c>VBCSCompiler</c> that outlive the tree Hub can see
/// (<see cref="ProcessRunner"/>'s kill walks the tree still attached to it).</para>
///
/// <para>The ladder only goes <b>up</b>, exactly as <see cref="GitCommandGrades"/>'s does: a command this does not
/// recognise keeps the tier it had (<see cref="ToolRisk.WorkspaceCommand"/>), so an omission costs a card nobody
/// needed rather than blocking a build nobody asked for. The shapes it cannot see are named rather than pretended
/// about: a wrapper script that is not itself a builder (<c>cmd /c build.bat</c>) and a payload held in a variable
/// (<c>pwsh -c $cmd</c>). Both stay inside the sandbox and still take the change gate
/// (<see cref="WorkspaceTools.RunCommand"/>), so the worst an omission can do is skip one question, never let two
